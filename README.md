# Dog-Vision---Multi-Class-Dog-Breed-Classification

This project implements an end-to-end solution for multi-class breed classification as identifying the breed of a dog from an image can be challenging due to the wide variety of breeds. 

## Overview 
This project aims to classify the images of dogs in one of 120 dog breeds. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition. 

## Dataset Details
- 120 different dog breeds (classes)
- Over 10,000+ labeled images in the training set.
- Test images are unlabeled.

## Deep Learning Approach
- Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for model building.
- Implements callbacks- Early Stopping and TensorBoard for efficient training and tracking.
